# bunch
When checking our code for project, please go to Bunch_Git folder. It has all the working code within that folder. Futher note, do not open bunch folder. 
Cloning directly from the link would not work. However, if you have all the files in your computer you would need to import the Bunch_Git separately from your android studio.
